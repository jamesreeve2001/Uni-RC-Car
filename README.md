For this university coursework, I was in a team of 6 students to design and create an RC car from scratch.
Our use case was to drive on a beach and find metal in the sand using a metal detector mounted to the bottom of the chassis. 
I designed and created the roll cage, which was able to withstand all of the available testing weights of 20kg.

As a group project, I have censored the other member's names and files for privacy purposes.
